So glad you could make it! This is the first post in what I hope becomes one of many. As always, please reach out and say hi üëã

Growing up I never really enjoyed writing. It felt like a chore and I much preferred the "tactile" activities like those found in science class. It wasn't until graduate school (late, I know) that I began to appreciate it more. The motivation for this site really comes from a few places: 

1. I've written how-to's and articles to help others with their questions so I figured why not reproduce for other internet passers-by to make use of.
2. I wanted a space to both 'play' (software is always evolving), but also share my other joys like music and photography in a way that I can't (and don't want to) through social media. 
3. I came across a post from Maggie Appleton about [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) that inspired me to be more open about sharing 'rough' ideas.

Also, shout out to [Javier Orraca](https://javierorraca.com/) for providing some much needed motivation to get this going. üôè

Not much else to say in my first post, but be sure to keep coming back for updates and additional content.
