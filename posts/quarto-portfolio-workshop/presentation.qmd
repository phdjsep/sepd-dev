## Quarto Hands-on Walkthrough

Let's take an introductory stroll through Quarto!


# Portfolio Site Structure

## Components of Your Portfolio Website

At a minimum, your portfolio website should include:

- **Home/About Me page**: A quick introduction to who you are and what you do.
- **Links to other profiles**: Provide easy access to your LinkedIn, GitHub, or other professional profiles.
- **Downloadable Resume**: Include a link to a PDF version of your resume.
- **Projects Page**: Showcase a list of your projects with brief descriptions and links.

### Additional Features to Consider

- **Blog**: Share insights, tutorials, or updates about your work and interests.
- **Hobbies Page**: Add a personal touch by sharing your hobbies or interests.

## Where to Start

### Biographical Blurb

- **Who are you?**: Introduce yourself and your background.
- **Where did you come from?**: Share a bit about your journey.
- **What is your personal mission and vision?**:
  - Mission: What do you do now?
  - Vision: Who do you aspire to become?

### Projects

- **List of Projects**: Highlight key projects you’ve worked on.
- **Short Descriptions**: Provide a brief overview of each project and its purpose.
- **Visuals**: Include photos, screenshots, or videos to make your projects stand out.


## The Basic Structure of a Quarto Site

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
### Key Components:
- **`_quarto.yml`**: The configuration file that defines your site's structure and settings.
- **`index.qmd`**: The homepage of your site.
- **Other pages and folders**: Additional pages (`about.qmd`, `blog.qmd`) and resources (e.g., images, styles).
- **Assets**: Folders for stylesheets, images, or other resources (e.g., `styles.css`, `assets/`).
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Quarto Portfolio Website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: projects/
        text: Projects
      - href: blog.qmd
        text: Blog

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```
:::
:::::


# Customizing

## Customizing your site

Next, we'll customize the site.

- Modify file structure to add pages.
- Modify `_quarto.yml`

## Modifying the file structure


::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

::: {.r-fit-text}
You can organize your files however you would like, but choosing a regular file structure will be very helpful.
I recommend the following general structure.

- `.gitignore` file: Includes the files to leave untracked in version control.
- `blog.qmd`: will load blog post from `posts/` folder
- `_site/`: auto-generated by Quarto, you don't need to create this folder. You should add it to your `.gitignore`.
- `projects/`: folder to organize projects.
- `projects/index.qmd`: page to display and list projects.
- `images/`: folder(s) to store images for your site and pages. Best to keep organized in the relevant folder (e.g., per project).
:::

:::
::: {.column}

**Sample project directory structure**

```bash
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── _quarto.yml
├── _site
│   └── ...
├── blog.qmd
├── images
│   └── headshot.jpeg
├── index.qmd
├── posts
│   └── first-post.qmd
├── projects
│   ├── example-project-1
│   │   ├── images
│   │   │   └── my_cat.jpeg
│   │   └── index.qmd
│   ├── example-project-2
│   │   ├── images
│   │   └── index.qmd
│   ├── index.qmd
│   └── template
│       ├── images
│       └── index.qmd
```
:::
:::::

## Creating your homepage

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Open `index.qmd` at the project root. This is your homepage.
- Create the following frontmatter structure, replacing the information with yours.
- Write a brief biographical blurb for yourself (you can easily change this later).
- Run `quarto preview` to check your updates.
:::
::: {.column}

```yaml
---
title: "Your Name"
image: images/headshot.jpeg # replace with the link to your headshot
about:
  template: jolla # see additional templates here https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html
  links:  # add links to your various social profiles
    - icon: linkedin
      text: LinkedIn
      href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/<yourhandle>
    - icon: github
      text: Github
      href: https://github.com/<yourhandle>
---

Enter your biography blurb here.
```
:::
:::::


## Add a Project Page

Let’s add a project page to showcase a basic data science project.

### Steps:

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
1. **Create a Subfolder**:  
   Inside the `projects/` folder, create a new subfolder named after your project (e.g., `iris`). Avoid spaces in the folder name.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
2. **Add Supporting Files**:  
   Inside your new project folder, add:
   - **`images/` folder**: Store any images or visualizations related to your project here.
   - **`index.qmd` file**: This will serve as the main page for your project.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
3. **Directory Structure Example**:  
   After completing the setup, your directory should look like this:

```bash
.
├── projects
│   ├──iris
│   │  ├── images/
│   │  └── index.qmd
```
:::

## Writing Markdown in Quarto

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
#### **What is Markdown?**
- Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-read format for writing text.  
- Quarto documents are built using Markdown, with some extensions for advanced features.
- Learn more at [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
#### **Headings**
- Use `#` symbols to create headings:
  - `# Heading 1` → `<h1>`
  - `## Heading 2` → `<h2>`
  - `### Heading 3` → `<h3>`
- Structure your content with proper heading levels for clarity.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
#### **Images**
- Embed images using the syntax:

`![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)`
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}

- [quarto.org](https://quarto.org)
:::

## Writing our Iris Project page

**Add Content to `index.qmd`**:  
Open `index.qmd` and describe your project. 

Include the following:

- A short introduction to the Palmer Penguins dataset.
- Key steps in your analysis (e.g., data cleaning, visualization, modeling).
- Include code snippets, plots, and conclusions.

Example content for `index.qmd`:

```{markdown}
---
title: Iris
author: Sep Dadsetan
date: 2024-11-11
image: images/ # A url to image here.
description: This is a description # Short description of the project to be shown on overview page.
---

# Iris Analysis

The **Iris dataset** is a great sample dataset. It contains information on iris species and sepal dimensions.

## Key Steps

yadda yadda
```

## Creating projects overview page

The last thing we need to do before we publish our site with the minimal setup is create a project overview page. To do this, open `projects/index.qmd` and add the following text.

```
---
title: Projects
---

## Iris

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
UCI: Iris Research Project
Check out this analysis I performed by following the link [here](iris/).
:::
::: {.column}
![](iris/images/)
:::
:::::

## Project #2
```

## Customizing `_quarto.yml`
::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
After you add the pages
:::
::: {.column}
```yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Quarto Portfolio Website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: projects/
        text: Projects
      - href: blog.qmd
        text: Blog

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```
:::
:::::


## Publishing Your Site 

We need to setup the Github repo to render the site from the `gh_pages` branch.

If it's a fresh repository, you won't have a `gh_pages` branch.
So, first we need to create an empty one. To do so, run the following code:

```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this!
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialising gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages
```

- After you finish this, go back to the main branch by running `git checkout main`.
This must be completed **before** you run `quarto publish`!

- Go to our Repo -> "Settings" -> Pages -> Create from branch and make sure `gh-pages` is selected.

Ta-da! 🎉 Site is published!

# Taking Your Portfolio to the Next Level

## Buy Your Own Domain Name

A personal domain is well worth your investment.
It will cost you around $20 a year, but it will give you a nice spot for your web presence and also a nice email.

- Go with a .com if it's available. (could also consider .me as well)
- Hover is a very friendly, straight-forward option to purchase your domain [(can use my referral code for $2 off)](https://hover.com/uYAUiF80)
- Other options are directly in AWS via Route53 (kinda complicated), Squarespace, and many others...

## Hosting Your Quarto Site

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
#### **How Hosting Works**
- A domain name provides a DNS entry (e.g., `yourwebsite.com`).
- The DNS entry must point to a server with an IP address where your site is hosted.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
#### **Hosting Options**
- **GitHub Pages**:  
  - Free and easy to set up.  
  - Perfect for static sites like Quarto.  
  - Example: Point your domain to `username.github.io`.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
- **Self-Hosting**:  
  - Run your own server with a public IP address.  
  - Offers full control but requires technical expertise.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
- **Conventional Web Hosting**:  
  - Use services like Bluehost or HostGator.  
  - Simplifies management while offering shared hosting plans.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
*"Choose the hosting option that best fits your site’s needs, budget, and your technical expertise."*
:::

## Other Useful Tools for Quarto Development

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
#### **VS Code Tools**
- **Markdown Extension**:  
  - Simplifies working with Markdown files.  
  - Features include:  
    - Easily paste images directly into your document.  
    - Automatically update filenames when renamed.  
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
- **Snippets**:  
  - Reusable pieces of code for common constructs.  
  - Save time by templating frequently used code (e.g., YAML headers or code chunks).  
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
*"Tools like these enhance your efficiency and make developing with Quarto even easier!"*
