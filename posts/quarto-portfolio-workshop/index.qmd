### Publishing Your Site 

<details>
    <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

We need to setup the Github repo to render the site from the `gh_pages` branch.

If it's a fresh repository, you won't have a `gh_pages` branch.
So, first we need to create an empty one. To do so, run the following code:

```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this!
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialising gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages
```

- After you finish this, go back to the main branch by running `git checkout main`.
This must be completed **before** you run `quarto publish`!

- Go to our Repo -> "Settings" -> Pages -> Create from branch and make sure `gh-pages` is selected.

Ta-da! ðŸŽ‰ Site is published!
