    "text": "So glad you could make it! This is the first post in what I hope becomes one of many. As always, please reach out and say hi üëã\nGrowing up I never really enjoyed writing. It felt like a chore and I much preferred the ‚Äútactile‚Äù activities like those found in science class. It wasn‚Äôt until graduate school (late, I know) that I began to appreciate it more. The motivation for this site really comes from two places:\n\nI‚Äôve written how-to‚Äôs and articles to help others with their questions so I figured why not reproduce for other internet passers-by to make use of.\nI wanted a space to both ‚Äòplay‚Äô (software is always evolving), but also share my other joys like music and photography in a way that I can‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt want to) through social media. This site is mine!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, shout out to Javier Orraca for providing some much needed motivation to get this going. üôè\n\n\n\nNot much else to say in my first post, but I want to share a tip to maybe make your visit worthwhile. It‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt see many data folks use so maybe it‚Äôs useful for you.\n\nInstalling Quarto Using Brew\n\nQuarto\nIf you‚Äôre from the R world I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of Quarto by now. In short, Quarto is a publishing system built on Pandoc that allows you to do all sorts of fun stuff (in Python, Julia, and ObservableJS also!) and you really need to check it out. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail as there are already MANY great resources online for what it is and how to use it for your needs. If there‚Äôs interest, I‚Äôd be happy to cover a scenario or two, but you‚Äôll have to let me know in the comments.\n\n\nBrew\nNow let‚Äôs get to the second character in our story, Homebrew. For those on the Mac, this is a very valuable tool to have on your machine as it helps with installing and managing a wide array of CLI (command line interface) tools as well as GUI (graphical user interface) applications. For example, if you wanted to install the RStudio IDE, rather than go to the Posit Downloads, download the application, and install it on your machine, you could install the RStudio IDE with a simple one-line command.\nbrew install --cask rstudio\nCool, right?! There‚Äôs a handy Medium article that lays out some of the neat abilities of brew. Make sure to check it out to get a better picture of it‚Äôs power.\n\n\nThe Benefits\nGreat, so now we know of Quarto and Brew how do the two work together? As you may have guessed, we can install quarto with brew, but why do that? With Quarto specifically, because it‚Äôs actively being developed and is updated so often, it ends up being kind of a PITA (pain-in-the-ass) to check the page for releases and then download and update your installation. So we can just rely on brew to help us do that with a single command üòÉ.\nbrew install --cask quarto\nEasy peasy. I hope that was a helpful tip. Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Is there a another way you manage software?\nTake the elevator back up?"

Hopefully you get to learn a little more about me AND not fall asleep in the process (unless this is somehow part of your bedtime routine üò¥).\n\nMy Interests\nQuite honestly there isn‚Äôt much that I‚Äôm not interested in. I find there‚Äôs something to learn from pretty much everyone, everything, and every scenario. If I were to choose some major themes however, they would be biology, technology, and music.\n\n\nWhere It Started\nFrom an early age (about 5 years old), I knew I wanted to be a scientist. The declaration came while in Yosemite. My Mom and her best friend were getting ready for a wedding. I was sitting on the bed intently watching the Discovery Channel when my Mom‚Äôs friend turned to me and asked, ‚ÄúI have a favor to ask you. Will you be the ring bearer?‚Äù. After a few seconds of thought, I cried and vehemently declared that I did not want to be a ring bearer and that, ‚ÄúI want to be a scientist!‚Äù. It was of course explained to me that the role was temporary and I could pursue both, so I graciously accepted the temporary ring bearer role. üòÜ\nA little later, around 7th grade (~ 1993), was when I decided I was going to study genetics in college. The Human Genome Project was underway and this cool frontier of understanding our DNA was captivating to me. I was fortunate enough to hold on to that dream and receive my B.S. in Genetics from UC Davis in 2003 and pseudo-fulfill my aspirations of becoming a scientist. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n\nTo Be Continued‚Ä¶"

    "text": "What is Quarto?\nQuarto helps you have your ideas and your code in one place, and present it in a beautiful way.\nQuarto unifies and extends the RMarkdown ecosystem - it unifies by combining the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system. And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù: accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love RMarkdown, and it‚Äôs for people who have never used RMarkdown.\nThe ability for Quarto to streamline collaboration has been so cool and important for our NASA Openscapes project. Quarto has been a common place for us to collaborate - across R and Python languages and coding expertise."

If you don‚Äôt already have a workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio. You don‚Äôt need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows.\nQuarto.org is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!"
